# Cover Letters
A cover letter is a one page document that highlights your qualifications, and it often accompanies your resume when you're applying for jobs. It's typicaly 3 paragraphs long and it expllains why you're applying for a position, gives you a brief overview of your professional background and why you're uniquely qualified. It can be required by some employers, but others may make it optional.

When writing it, think of your cover letter as an introduction to your resume, rather than a restatement of it. Unless explicitly told not to, you should always send a cover letter to strengthen your application.

## Cover Letter Outline:

### Date and Contact information: 
Include the date, your name, full address, phone number, and email (An online cover letter). For paper cover letters you can also include the hiring manager's name, company name, and full company address. All of this info is on the top left corner.

### Salutation/Greeting: 
Address the hiring manager. Don't use 'Mr.', 'Mrs.' or 'Ms.', rather just use their first or last name. Als oif you can't find their name then it's recommended you use 'Dear Hiring Manager'. Avoid outdated greeints such as 'Dear Sir/Madam' or 'To Whom It May Concern'.

### Opening Paragraph:
Catch their attention in this paragraph. Introduce yourself and express enthusiasm. Here you include why you're excited about the job and the company. Talk about how it lines up with career goals and include keywords from job posting and match your own skills ot the employer's requirements. Here you're 
making statements and briefly overviewing your skills. 

If you were referred by someone who knows the hiring manager or already works at the company, mention your referral here.

### Middle paragraphs:
Discuss your most relevant experiences, talk about specific skills and qualifications that make you a good candidate. Pitch yourself as the ideal match for the role. Here you're talking in somewhat detail about your skills and experience and how it relates and would make you good. You may do this in one or two paragraphs.

### Optional paragraph:
You can write an optional paragraph to convince the employer that you have the personal qualities to succeed at the specific company and role. You can disucss your interests/passions to what you know about the company. Here you show why you're interested in this company, industry, and the work itself. With this paragraph you likely want to do a little research on the company. Quickly learn about their mission goals, the things they're about, and what they're currently doing, and how that relates to you.


### Closing paragraph: 
Here we just thank them for their time and consideration. You may also clarify any details from your resume. So like if you have employment gaps, explain why that happened. You can also use this to summarize your qualifications, and express your interest in continuing onto the next stage of the hiring process

### Complementary Close And Signature:
Choose a formal closing that's followed by your first and last name. However they can't be too casual/affectionate such as 'Cheers', 'Warm Regards', or 'Yours Truly'. Here are some that are ideal and good:
1. Sincerely
2. Regards
3. Best
4. Respectfully
5. Thank you
6. Thank you for your consideration


## Researching:
Investing some time researching the company and position would do well when making some of your paragraphs. Like simply looking at the job-listing and description helps a lot. For example if you see a tech job that says, "Requires experience in languages Python, C++, Java" and "Preferred experience in deployment technologies such as docker", you can use that in your cover letter, and relate your skills to show that you meet those requirements. This is helpful for your middle paragraphs, where you talk about the specific experiences or skills you have and how they make you a perfect fit for the role. Analyze the job position and also the keywords, and make sure to include those keywords in your cover letter so it gets past the application system. 

Also this is good if you want to write the optioanl paragraph talking about why you're interested in the company, personal qualities, and passions you have. 



## Font, spacing, and other things to consider:

### Font
Choose a basic font like Arial, Calibri, Verdana, or something similar. Something that looks professional. Avoid using fancy or decorative fonts. Many companies use tech looks for specific keywords, skills, job titles, etc. This is why it's recommended to include those keywords in your cover letter or resume. Anyways the point is complicated fonts make it harder for that software to read, preventing your documents from moving forward.

Use 10 or 12 point sizes for easy reading. Generally we'll use the same font and font size that was used in your resume.

### Spacing
- Make it single spaced.
- Add a space betwee each section, so contact info, saluation, middle paragraph, closing paragraph, etc. No need to indent your paragraphs either.

### Length Guidelines:
Ideally keep it as a single page made up of three paragraphs. You can add an extra middle paragraph if necessary, but the idea is to convey the information without adding unnecessary fluff.

### Margin and Alignment:
Use left text alignment and have standard 1-inch margins. If you find your letter spilling to the second page, try to cut things and make things shorter if possible. If not, then you may shrink the margins to 3/4 or 1/2-inch, but avoid going smaller than that.

### File Format:
Try to save your document in a compatible file format such as a word doc or pdf. Rename your doc to something specific since hiring managers can see the fileanme of your online submission. A good standard would be 'FirstName-LastName-CoverLetter'.

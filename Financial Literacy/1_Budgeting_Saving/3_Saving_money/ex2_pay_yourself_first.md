# Paying Yourself First

- The idea of putting yourself, your needs and taking
  care of yourself first. So when we receive income, let's prioritize
  saving that money first, before paying our needs and wants.

- Situation: You want to buy a $624 laptop, and you're giving
  yourself a year to get it. Of course, depending on the frequency
  of our paychecks, the math changes a bit. But the idea is that
  every time we get our pay, we firstly and always set aside
  some of that money towards our goal.

1. Weekly savings: $12 per week
2. Biweekly savings: $624 / 26 weeks = $24 per week
3. Semi-monthly (Most months don't have four weeks): $624 / 24 semi-months = $26 per semimonth
4. Monthly: $52 per month

- Another example is when you're saving up for a $1,300 vacation that's in exactly one year, and you
  get paid bi-weekly. So $1,300 / 26 pay periods = $50 saved each period. So
  after every paycheck, set aside $50, and after a year you'll have
  the money to go on vacation.

- NOTE: Paying yourself last? This would be the idea of having 'savings' as
  the least prioritized thing. In most cases, it's likely you already spent
  your money on other things, and have nothing left for savings. So always
  pay yourself first.

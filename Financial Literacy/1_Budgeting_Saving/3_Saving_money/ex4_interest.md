# Interest Rates

- When keeping your money in a savings account, it will grow over
  time. This increase in money is called 'interest'.

- Interest: Additional money the bank gives you for trusting it to
  store your money. The more money you have in your account and
  the longer you keep it there, the more interest it earns.

# How does interest work

- The bank calculates interest as a percentage of the
  total amount that you have in your account. That percentage,
  which is known as 'interest rate' is defined by the bank.
  Interest is typically yearly, and it's also known as
  APY (annual-percentage-yield). The amount of money your
  savings account yields or earns after a year.

- For example, let's say you have $500 in your savings account.
  The APY, is 1%. Every year you get 500(0.01) = $5 added to that account.
  Then next year you have $505 dollars, and you'll earn 5% of that as well.
  This is also the idea of compound interest, where our interest earns us
  even more interest.

# Compound Interest vs Simple Interest

- Simple interest: Interest is calculated only on
  the original amount, and as a result the amount of interest
  you get is constant throughout the period. You aren't adding
  any interest onto the pile.
- Compound Interest: Calculated using the initial amount and the
  accumulated interest from previous periods. So here the interest
  is always increasing, as we're adding more onto the pile.

- NOTE: For a savings account, compound interest is used, and it makes
  us more money. However note that compound interest can work against us
  as well such as student loan debt. Here the longer we don't pay the debt,
  the faster the rate it's going to increase.

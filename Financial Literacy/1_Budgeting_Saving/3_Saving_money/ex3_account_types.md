# Types of savings accounts

- There are various types of savings accounts, so
  you need to choose the one that's most appropriate
  for you and your goal.

# Considering goals

- Are you saving for a specific purchase such as
  a house or car, or a general safety net such as an emergency fund?
  Knowing what you're saving for helps you out, and also knowing this
  whilst talking to a bank representative would be useful as well.

# Savings account requirements and conditions:

- Requirements: Sometimes you'll pay a minimum initial
  deposit requirement to start the account. Meaning you'll
  have to store some money in the account upfront to start it.
- Access Restrictions: Different banks have different rules
  about when you can even touch the money or access it. Sometimes
  you can withdraw money from your savings account freely, but
  other times probably not. Make sure you understand the rules
  before siging up.

# Shopping around and account types:

- Banks usually have different types of savings accounts with
  different features and fees. So you'll compare them and ask
  for advice.

1. Traditional Savings Account: A common account type, where banks
   give you a small amount of interest for keeping your money with
   them. Typically the interest is small, and there are no opening fees.
   A good place to start.

2. High-yield savings account: Offers a higher interest rate, however
   there would be more restrictions suc has minimum balance requirement
   and withdrawal limits.

3. Money market account: An account offered by banks and
   credit unions. They pay higher interest, but there are limits
   such as amount of transactions you can make by check, debit, etc.
   Usually there are unlimited withdrawals, but there likely is a
   initial deposit fee.

4. Certificate of deposit (CD): You agree to keep your money with the bank
   within a given time frame. The money will grow at a high interest rate and
   you get your money at the end of the time frame. However if you withdraw the money
   before the time is up, you pay a penalty.

# About Saving Money:

- When we save money we are working towards those future goals
  or casting a safety net in case of emergencies or rainy days.

# How to save money

- Of course after calculating the budgets for your needs and wants, make
  sure you're meeting the budget of at least saving 20% of your income every month.
  Setup automation so that a percentage of every paycheck is deposited into
  your savings account. As a result you don't even have to think about it.
  This is likely the most efficient way, and of course set it up so that
  you're getting paid via direct deposit, which makes the whole thing easier.

# Planned vs Unplanned expenses

- Planned Expenses: Expenses from things that you know are coming.
  Such as rent, car payments, utilities, etc. Plan out how much
  you need to save in the time frame you have.

  1. Figure out what we're saving for.
  2. Set a total amount and time frame, so we know how much we
     need to allocate each month or week. Have this money in
     another account for this specific goal to keep your things organized.
  3. Automate with automatic transfer from your checking to that
     savings account so you won't have to transfer the money yourself.
  4. Adjust your budget, if you're not saving enough. This is the
     first thing we should be doing when reflecting after each month.

  - For example, if your yearly car payment is $1200, you
    know you need to save up $100 each month. Or if you're
    going to save for a new laptop that's $750 and you're giving
    ourself a 4 month timeframe, that's $187.5 each month. So
    when saving towards these goals, always 20%, but also keep
    in mind the actual numbers when you divide that 20% across your
    goals.

- Unplanned Expenses: Things that pop up unexpectedly. Such as a
  medical bill, car repair, etc. For example, if your car fails,
  then you're going to miss work and have extra expenses for other
  modes of transportations, or borrow money to get your car fixed.
  Always remember to save that 20% so that you have a safety net for yourself.

# Emergency Fund

- A savings account specifically set aside for unplanned expenses. The
  goal is to have enough funds to cover costs if something bad comes up.
  Suggested you 3-6 months worth of living expenses/money saved up.
  When we mean 3-6 months of 'living expenses' 3-6 months of monthly needs budget.
  Most, if not all of your money should be going here until you reach about 3-6 months
  of savings considering your monthly savings budget.

- For example, with a monthly salary of $5,200, you know about $1040
  should be saved each month for your 20% savings budget. Let's say
  your needs or 'living expenses' is $2600 per month. The rule is to save
  3-6 months worth of living expenses so that's $7800 or $15600. Let's
  set our goal to $15600. So in total, it'd take us 15 months to reach
  our goal.

- Though after you reach your goal, you will have a surplus in your regular
  income because you probably stopped funding your emergency fund. At this point,
  it's wise to fund that money into other goals such as buying a house, car, etc.
  Revisit your emergency fund every year, especially in cases when your income
  changes, and in that case you may want to grow it so that it accounts for other
  possessions or people in your life.

# Negotiating bills

- It's possible to negotiate bills with your service
  provider.

1. Know your options: Before calling, research the competition.
   This way you can know the rates and plans that other companies offer,
   and mentioning a cheaper plan from a competitor could persuade your
   provider to help you out.
2. Be polite and firm: Of course we polite and respectful, but make
   it clear it you're serious about wanting to lower your bill. Talk
   about how you've been looking at other providers and have been
   considering the idea of making the switch if they don't work with you.
3. Ask for a supervisor: If the customer service representative can't help
   you don't be afraid to ask for a supervisor. People in higher posiitons have
   more authority to do things and negotiate.
4. Be persistent: If you aren't successful the first time, call back again in
   a few days. Some representatives can be more helpful than others.
5. Look for a promotional offer: If you're not successful in lowering your
   bill, ask for any available promotional offers. Sometimes service providers
   have deals such as new plans or bundles that could be more affordable than
   your current situation.

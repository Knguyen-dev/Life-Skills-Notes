# Consumer Protection 101
- Situation: When you buy a product or service, we might not be happy with what we got. Maybe it didn't work properly, company wasn't being fair, etc. If this happens, you can file a consumer complaint to get help and get your situation resolved.
## How to file consumer complaints and follow up

### Step 1: Contact the seller or provider first:
Before making a big deal out of it and filing a formal complaint, try to talk to the company that sold you the product or service. If they don't move, go to step 2.

### Step 2: Gather evidence and documentation
Collect any information you have about the problem such as receipts, photos, emails, etc. This will help you show what happened and why you need help.

### Step 3: Choose the appropriate agency/authoriy
Different agencies handle different types of complaints. Research the agency and analyze the complaint before moving forward.
- Better Business Bureau (BBB): Helps with complaints about businesses in general. They're the ones that help out when there's problems with a goods or services a business is offering. As well as this, they're good
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB): Focuses on complaints related to financial products and services. These are things such as banking products (checking accounts, savings accounts, etc.), loans and credit, investment products, insurance products, payment services, etc. 
- State Securities Board (SSB): Deals with complaints about investments and securities (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other representations of ownership).

### Step 4: Fill out the complaint form or letter
Then you'll fill out an online complaint form or write a letter, very easy to find while on the agency's website. You'll include all the important details and attach your evidence. Be clear and concise when explaining the issue.

## Possible outcomes 
You may get compensated with a refund, replacement, or repair for your product or service. Sometimes legal action could be taken against the seller or company in question. If this happens, the agency you contacted will help guide you through the process. However the agency may find that the company in question wasn't at fault, or the evidence you gave wasn't sufficient.

## Examples of complaints
### Successful complaint
A person bought some shoes, but when they arrived they were in the wrong side. The company said they couldn't help when he called, so we filed a complaint to the 'Better Business Bureau'. As a result, the company was forced to send the correct size shoes and provided a return label for the incorrect pair.
### Unsuccessful complaint
A person buys a videogame and doesn't like it because it's too difficult. They tried returning it but the store didn't accept it since the box was already opened. After filing a complaint to the BBB, the agency couldn't help because the game wasn't faulty or falsely advertised.

## Following up and keeping track of a complaint
After filing a complaint, keep track of and stay in touch with the agency or seller to see if they're working on your problem. If you don't get the help you need, you may try something else like tlaking to a lawyer or asking help from a different group.

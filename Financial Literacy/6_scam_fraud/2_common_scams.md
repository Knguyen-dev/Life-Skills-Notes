# How to spot and avoid common fraud schemes

## Investment scams
When someone tricks you into investing in something that doesn't exist or isn't worth as much as they claim. 
- Red flags: Watch out for promises of high returns, pressure to act quickly, and unsolicited offers.
- Example: In today's world, you'll see many advertisements for the latest cryptocurrency. They say it's going to be worth a lot, and that you should invest quick. The price rises as more people buy into it, and then the original person sells all of their coins. They gain a lot of money and essentially destroy the value of the original cryptocurrency beyond recover, so everyone else with the currency can't make their money back as it's now worthless. This is called a 'pump and dump'.


## Pyramid Scheme
Scam where people make money by recruiting others to join the scheme. The people at the top of the company, or pyramid, make money from those below them. Eventually, the pyramid will collapse, causing most to lose their money, and the ones at the top to come out clean.
- Red flags: Be suspicious of opportunities that require you to recruit others to make money or ask for a large upfront 'start-up' free.
- Example: Herbalife is a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and personal care products. Some accuse it to be a pyramid scheme, saying that they spend more time on recruiting new distributors than actually selling their own products.


## Phishing scams
WHen someone pretends to be a trustworthy person or company to get your personal or financial info. They'll send you an email, text, or call and ask for your information, posing as a legitimate person.
- Red flags: Suspect unsolicited emails or messages that ask for personal info. Always verify the identity of the sender or caller before giving out any information. For example, calling up your actual bank to check if things are okay. Calling the actual company to ensure your account is secure, before proceeding with this random person on the phone.
- Example: In 2019, a Texas school district lost $2.3 million because an employee fell for a phishing scam. The scammer pretended to be from a construction company that the school worked with, and tricked the guy to sending money to the wrong account.

## Check cashing scam
When someone tricks you into cashing a fake check or accepting fake electronic payment. Then they'll ask you to send some money for them. In the end, the bank will say the check is invalid, and you've lost money.
- Red flags: Beware of checks that come from people you don't know, or are a larger amount than you expected. Never send money to someone you don't know or trust.

## Home renovation scam
When someone offers to do work on your home, like fixing your roof or painting, but they either don't do the work or do a terrible job. They'll ask for upfront payment, and then disappear with your money.

- Red flags: Be cautious of unsolicited offers for home repairs and always check the credibility of the contractor before giving them any money.

## How to avoid falling for scams
1. Do research and background check: Look up the company, person, or offer online to see if it's real. If you receive an unsolicited call, email, etc. don't automatically trust it. Contact the company directly via phone or a website you know is genuine.
2. Never give out personal or financial info: Scammers will often ask for this crucial info to steal your identity and money. Keep this to yourself, and never reveal this to strangers and people you don't trust.
3. Report suspicious activity: If you think you've been targeted by a scam, report it to the authorities such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or local police.

Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it usually is. Use this information to protect yourself from scams.

# How to protect your personal info

## Pesonal Identifiable Information (PII)
Any info that can clearly identify you as an individual, akin to shining a spotlight on a crowd of people to focus on a single individual. this includes your name, social security number, credit card number, bank account number, etc. When someone steals any of your PII they can use it for identify theft.

## What is identity theft?
Happens when someone uses another person's personal info, like their name, ssn, etc. to commit fraud or do other crimes under the guise of the other person. For example here are some examples: 
1. Taking out loans or making purchases using another person's card.
2. Filling tax returns using someone else's ssn.
3. Using someone else's identity ot submit fraudulent insurance claims
4. Committing crimes using another person's identity to avoid detection.

Obviously this can be pretty bad as you can lose a lot of money from this, and be charged with fees, crimes, and other things that you weren't responsible for.

1. Stealing your wallet, giving them access to your bank cards, driver's license, ssn card.
2. Stealing your mail; thieves can get access to things such as your bills, which contain your personal information that they can use.
3. Getting your data via data breaches, which is when computer systems are hacked and hackers get the company's data. This can include the customers, clients, and users that interact with the company.
4. Phishing scams, which is when someone calls you or sends you fraudent email or messages, pretending to be a real service, and trying to trick you into giving away your personal information.

You give them your name, ssn, etc. You trust them since they sound legit. However later you realize your bank account is empty, and cards have been used for unexpected purchases. You've been a victim of identity theft.

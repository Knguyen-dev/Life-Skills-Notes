# Debt and how it grows
- The money we owe to others. Usually we pay it back with interest. Overtime debt can grow because of interest, fees and penalties. For example, you take out a $5,000 that has a 5% apr. Meaning it'll grow $250 each year if left alone.



- Good debt: When you borrow money to make an investment of some kind, allowing you to earn more money or financially benefit in the end. As a result you can pay off your loan, and still have more money in the end. For example, going to school to get a degree, but it could increase your job prospects and income. Or taking out a mortgage to have a home for your family.

- Bad debt: When you're borrowing money that you don't really need to. Here you take away from your future self. For example, borrowing to eat at a fancy restaurant or buying some nice clothes. Satiating these wants may be fun in the moment, but they'll hurt you in the future.

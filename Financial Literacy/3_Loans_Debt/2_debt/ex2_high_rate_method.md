# High Rate Method:
- When you have multiple debts, the most mathematically optimal way to pay off your debt is using the high rate method. You pay off the debts with the highest interest (APR) first. 

# High Rate Method Exercise:
- Credit card: $500 (principal), 15% APR, $20 (minimum payment)
- Retail card: $4000, 30% APR, $30 
- Loan a: $2000, 10% APR, $75 
- Loan b: $3500, 5% APR, $75 

1. Minimum payment is $200 a month. So pay off those first. We have left over money to pay off a debt.
2. Pay off retail card, since it has highest APR. So keep paying off the monthly minimum payment, and put the rest in paying off the retail card.
3. Then do the credit card since it's the second highest apr.
4. Then loan a, and finally loan b.

# Snowball method:
- A method where you pay the lowest balances firts. However, this is not optimized, and you will pay more interest and it'll take longer to pay off your debt. So you'll hear of this method, just ignore it as it's not recommended.

 # Bankruptcy
- Bankruptcy: A situation where a person or company can't payback the money they owe to others, so they ask the federal court for help to find a solution to pay off their debt. 
1. Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (Straight Bankruptcy): Your assets are taken and split amongst your creditors. All of your belongings are taken, and are given to your creditors as compensation. As a result, you've lost everything, except for living essentials, but now you're free of debt. This stays on your credit report for 10 years, so it isn't an easy 'cure' for debt as some certain loans aren't forgiven. So there are a lot of rules, so consult a professional before proceeding.
2. Chapter 13 Bankruptcy (Reorganization): You have a stable income, but you can't realistically pay off your debt. You and your creditor negotiate a deal or payment plan that better helps you pay off your debt more realistically. This helps repay some or all of your debt over a 3-5 year period. After your repayment plan, all or at least some of your debt is eliminated. However, you can only qualify for this if you have a stable and regular income. Stays on your report 7 years after you file for bankruptcy.

- NOTE: Other chapters of bankruptcy exist such as chapter 11, which is like organization, but for businesses. Another is chapter 12, which gives benefits towards farmers and fishermen. But for most people, they're going to be dealing with chapter 7 and chapter 13 bankruptcy.

# Reasons for bankruptcy:
- There could be various reasons for bankruptcy. Some that you can control and others that you can't.
1. Medical expenses: Most common reason, as if you don't have medical insurance, the bill could be really expensive.
2. Job loss: If you don't have an income or savings to pay off your bills, then you're now in debt and then bankruptcy.
3. Divorce: When divorcing, the income is split in half between both people, but their expenses stay the same, which sometimes makes it hard for the newly single people to pay their bills.
4. Failed business: Starting a business costs a lot of money, and if it doesn't succeed you could be in a lot of debt. People sometimes invest everything into a business to the point where if it fails, they have nothing left.

# Comparing Chapter 7 and 13:
1. Time: Chapter 7 is usually faster (3-6 months), while chapter 13 is 3-5 years.
2. Property: You'll lose some of your assets with chapter 7, while you'll keep your property in chapter 13.
3. Eligibility: Not everyone is eligible for chapter 7 as you must pass a 'means test' that examines your income and expenses. Chapter 13 is only availale to people who have a stable income and can afford to repay some of their debts. 
4. Credit report: Chapter 7 stays for 10 years, while chapter 13 stays only for 7 years.

# Takeaway:
- Remember this is a serious decision that should only be considered as a last resort. It has long lasting consequences for your credit, so talk to a professional and weigh your options first.

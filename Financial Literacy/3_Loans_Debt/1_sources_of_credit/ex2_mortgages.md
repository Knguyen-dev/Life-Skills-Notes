# Mortgages and how they work:
- Mortgage: A loan used to purchase a home or property. Houses are expensive, so people usually apply for a mortgage loan as a way to get a house. The bank (lender) agrees to loan to you money to pay most of the house's price. You typically pay upfront a percentage called a downpayment. Then you agree that over a series of installations, you'll pay back the money the bank loaned you with interest. If you pay it all, you own the house, else if you miss a payment the bank can take you house. Then they'll sell it to make up the money they loaned you.

# Steps for a mortgage:
1. Application: Person applies for a mortgage loan from a lender, typically a bank or mortgage company. Here the lender evalutes your credit and how trustworthy you are.
2. Approval: Upon approval, the lender agrees to provide the majority of the money needed to purchase the home. The borrower typically agrees to make an upfront payment, known as a downpayment, which will typically be a smaller portion of the house's price. The percentage of the house you paid is the equity you own on the house. Equity is the difference between your home's price and how much you owe on your mortgage.
3. Ownership & lien: Borrower is the legal owner of the home, but the lender places a lien on the property. A lien is just the legal right that lets the lender take the home if the borrower fails to repay the loan. 
4. Repayment & Interest: Borrower will repay the loan with monthly payments in interest overtime until the borrower has fully repaid the loan. The 'amortization period' is the time would take for them to pay off the loan, which can be 15-30 years. However if it's repaid, the borrower gains full ownership of the home, and the lender has no claim on it.
5. Default & Foreclosure: If the borrower misses payments and defaults on the loan, the lender can take the property from them. With this they can sell the property to make up for the money they lent you for buying it in the first place. This is what it means when the house acts as collateral, as it's a safety net in the sense that if you default on the loan, they can use the house to financially recuperate.

# Types of mortgages:
- Here are two common types of mortgages
1. Fixed-Rate Mortgage: Interest rate remains constant throughout the loan. So the monthly payment amount stays the same. 
2. Adjustable Rate Mortgage: The interest rate can be subject to change, which means the monthly payment mount can change.

# Mortgage exercise:
- interest annual rate: 5.5%; this is a fixed rate mortgage so the interest rate doesn't change.
- monthly interest rate: 0.46%; Literally 5.5% / 12 months
- Home purchase price: $500,000
- downpayment: You contribute a 25% downpayment ($125,000). So you have $125,000 equity in your home or you have 25% equity on your house, that's the amount of it you own.
- loan amount: Bank contributes remaining 75% ($375,000)
- Term (Amortization period): 30 years
- marginal tax rate: 35%
- monthly payment: $2,129.21

1. On your first month the interest is $375,000 * 0.0046, which is $1,718.75 of interest you have to pay alongside your monthly payment. That first is added to your pre-payment balance so now you need to pay $376,718.75. 
Now paying both of those, you really only paid $410 to your original loan balance which is now $374,177.20. So yeah in the beginning it's tough as it's a fight with interest rather than the loan balance.
2. Your equity, price of home subtracted by loan amount, is now $125,410, evne though you made that $2000+ payment.
3. However, as the loan balance gets smaller and smaller, there's less interest to pay. So more of your $2,129.21 monthly payment actually goes to paying off the loan balance. Until finally on the last payment, all of money is going to the loan balance, and you've paid off the loan.

# Interest is tax deductible
- Let's say you make $100k a year, and you pay 35% in taxes, so 35k goes to taxes. Now in year 1, we say we paid $10,000 in interest. This is tax deductible as I can subtract this from my income and say my income is actually $90,000 this year. So 35% of my $90,000 would be $31500, so I'm paying a little less. This is what we mean by tax deductible, as we can deduct an amount from your income and report that amount to the IRS as our income so that we pay less taxes. Us paying less makes sense as we're already financially committing to something else. We'll explain more about taxes later though.

- NOTE: In general, you can deduct the mortgage interest you paid during the tax year on the first $750,000 of your mortgage debt for your primary home or a second home. If you are married filing separately, the limit drops to $375,000. For example, if you buy a $800,000 house, the interest is tax deductible for the first $750,000 you pay on the loan. Though you should probably consult a tax professional, such as a certified public accountant for more complex matters.

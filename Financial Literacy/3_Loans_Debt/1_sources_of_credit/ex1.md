# Credit and Lending
- Situation: You want to pay for something without waiting months or years to save up the money. 
- One solution: One solution would be borrowing money from a financial institution. This is called taking out a loans or using credit, as when we borrow money, we agree to pay it back later, with some extra money on top in the form of interest and fees. This is the cost of using someone else's money.

# Why use credit?:
- Here are the various reasons a person might use credit rather than their own money:
1. Buying a car: Cars are expensive, and so many people take out a car loan from the bank, credit union, or car seller. Here they'll be able to use the car and drive it, while making monthly payments with interest on the loan.
2. Buying a house: Most people mortgage their house. As a result, they mortgage from a bank, credit union, etc. They pay the money for the house over time instead of all at once.
3. College: School is expensive, which is why many people get student loans from lenders to pay for it.
4. Emergencies: People use credit to pay off bills caused by sickness, legal problems, etc.

# Types of lenders:
1. Banks: Banks offer many types of loans and credit such as mortgages, car loans, personal loans, credit cards, etc. There will be conditions such as credit score, a steady income, and a downpayment or some form of collateral such as property.
2. Merchants: Places that sell products or services such as stores, car sellers, etc. Lend money to their customers by themselves or through a bank. They usually have easier requirements, just needing proof of identity, income, and a downpayment. Usually they have high interest rates though.
3. Payday loans: Short and expensive loans that give you cash until your next payday. They charge high interest rates and even fees. It's recommended to avoid these as it's often predatory and target people who are desperate for money. They want stuff a pay stuff and bank statements to know that you have an income, and typically ignore your credit score.
4. Title loans: Short and expensive loans that are backed by the title of a vehicle. You're loaned money, but you offer your vehicle as a form of collateral. It's typically not recommended, as a lot of other options are better than potentially losing your vehicle.



# Payday loans exercise:
1. Let's say you borrow $500. Your pay day is in 2 weeks, so in two weeks you'll write them a check.
2. For every $100 borrowed, you pay back $25 extra. So you pay $625.
3. Once payday comes in, you can either pay $625 in cash, or they'll cash in that check you gave them. Note that they're taking money on your payday, so that money is going to them first, rather than important things such as rent, utilties, etc.
4. This is 25% interest per two weeks. So the apr would be 650%, which is crazy.
- As a result, payday loans are bordering on scams that prey on desperate people, so never resort to them. This goes into our topic of predatory lenders.

# Predatory Lenders:
- For predatory lenders, they don't care about the financial well being of the borrower, and actually want to make it hard for them to repay the loan. So that they can get the most money out of a person possible.
1. Payday lenders
2. Car title lenders
3. Subprime mortgage lenders
- NOTE: There may be other aspects of a loan that's predaory in nature such as hidden fees or aggressive collection practices. Anothe danger is where a lender tells you to take out more loans to pay off previous ones. Leading to a cycle of debt.

# Predatory Lending Practices:
1. Extremely high interest rates
2. Hidden fees
3. Targeting vulnerable populations
4. Aggressive marketing tactics
5. Encouraging repeated borrowing
6. Little regard for credit score or ability to repay.

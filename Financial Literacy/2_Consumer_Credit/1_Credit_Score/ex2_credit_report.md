# Credit Report:

- Credit report: Document that shows how you use your money
  and pay your bills.

# What's in a credit report:

1. Personal information such as name, address, date of birth, social security number.
2. Current and previous accounts, such as credit cards, loans, utilities, etc.
3. Payment history which shows whether you paid on time or missed some.
4. Your credit limit, balance, and available credit.
5. Public records such as any bankruptcies.
6. Any credit inquiries, so when others such as lenders have checked your
   credit or when you've checked your own credit.

# Who manages credit reports:

- Credit reports are made by the three major credit bureaus.
  Again, they collect information from lenders, employers, and other
  people who work with you. They use this information to calculate
  your credit score, and whatnot.

# How to get credit report and its overall importance:

- You can get it for free once every 12 months from
  each of the three credit bureaus. You can request a
  free one online at "www.annualcreditreport.com" or
  call their phone at 1-877-322-8228.
- If you see any errors or fraud, dispute it with the credit bureau.
  It's important to review your credit report to see if there are
  any errors, since those errors can negatively impact your score.
  Watch for things such as identity theft such as when there's an
  account that's opened in your name, but it wasn't you who opened it.

# Credit report vs credit history:

- Credit report is a document that contains your credit history.
  Your credit history is your financial history involving any lines
  of credit. Any mortgages, loans, and any transaction involving any
  other lines of credit.

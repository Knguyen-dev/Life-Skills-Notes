# Credit Score

- Credit score: A numerical measure of how likely you are to make
  payments on something on time. How likely are you to pay back
  a loan, a house payment, etc. It's a measure of how financially
  responsible or trustworthy you are to other institutions, and is
  a major decider to whether companies should lend you money.
  The score can be from 350 to 850, and the higher your score the better.

  1. 300-579: Poor credit score, so it's difficult to get approved
     for credit cards or loans. If approved, you pay a high interest rate.
  2. 580-669: Fair, you may get approved, though interest rates
     are still high.
  3. 670-739: Good, approved for most things, and interest rates are better.
  4. 710-799: Very good, you know the rest.
  5. 800-850: Excellent, you shouln't have problems for approvals, and you
     have the best interest rates.

# Credit Bureaus:

- There are 3 credit bureaus that control credit scores: TransUnion, Experian, Equifax.
  Whenever you successfully pay your credit card balance on time, or fail, that is
  reported to one of these credit bureaus, and they take that into account and
  re-adjust your credit score. Some things that affect your score:

1. How long you've had credit accounts such as a credit card or a loan.
2. Amount of money you owe.
3. Whether or not you make payments on time.
4. If you've ever filed for bankruptcy.

- NOTE: Credit bureaus calculate your score using an algorithm that comes
  from a company called FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation)

# How to raise and maintain a good credit score:

1. Pay bills on time: Late payments negatively impact your credit score,
   so pay your bills on time, and full. Paying card balances protects
   your score, and it saves money in interest.
2. Keep credit utilization low: Credit utilization is the percentage of
   the available credit you can use on your credit card. For example
   if you have a $1,000 limit on your card, and you use $500 (your credit balance).
   Your credit utilization is 50%. The well-known guideline says that
   you can't go over 30% as that's the maximum, if you go over then it hurts you.
   However, most experts and sources say to keep it around 10% for an excellent
   score. People with the highest scores tend to keep it around here. Just make
   sure it isn't 0%, and you're actually using your card. Here's a list of
   things to keep in mind to lower our credit utilization rates:
3. Monitor your credit report: Keep an eye on your credit report to make
   sure there aren't any errors that hurt your score. If there are, go to your
   bank to dispute them.
4. Build a long history: Your credit score is also based on how long you've
   been using credit. It's important that we don't close any credit accounts
   even if we haven't used them.
5. Avoid applying for many cards: Applying for a new credit card account
   does lower your score a bit, but it will help you in the long run to build good credit.
   However, if we apply for many cards in a short period of time, this can add up
   and damage our score moderately.
6. Keep a mix of credit types: Having different types of credit such as a mortgage,
   car loan, and credit card shows you're able to manage different types of credit.
   As a result, your score increases.
7. Avoid usual bads: Such as missing payments, debt, many credit cards,
   defaulting on a loan, or having a short credit history.

- NOTE: When starting off you'll have a short credit history, and
  a bad score. That's makes sense, so don't panic. Every month, just keep
  building upon it. Pay your bills, and ensure you keep your utilization at around 10%.

# Keeping credit utilization low:

1. Pay credit card balances early or before each statement period.
2. Raise the limits on your card.
3. Open new lines of credit. Card A and B have $5000 each, so your
   overall limit is now $10,000 dollars. If you have a balance of $500 and
   $500 respectively, that means your utilization is 10%.
4. Don't close your credit card accounts. Keeping them open helps maintain that lower
   utilization rate since those limits add to our overall available credit. Of course
   you may want to close a card due to an annual fee, and this increases the utilization
   ratio, which of course lowers your credit score. This is why it's advised not to, but
   sometimes it is necessary.

# How to safely close a card:

1. Pay off all of your credit card accounts, not just the one you're cancelling,
   before canceling any card. If your balance is $0, then your credit utilization is zero
2. Redeem all unused rewards from your card.
3. Call credit card issuer to cancel your card and confirm the balance is $0.
4. Follow up with a mailed letter or an email to the credit card
   issuer, where you request for written confirmation that your card has been
   closed and the balance was $0. This way you can document the date you requested the cancellation.
5. Check your credit reports 30 to 45 days after cancellation to ensure
   the account reports that it was closed by the cardholder and the balance was $0.

- NOTE: All in all paying off all of your cards first before canceling
  gives you a better chance of avoiding or at least minimizing any damage
  caused to your credit score when closing a card.

# Importance of a good credit score:

- Primarily important when applying for loans and credit cards.
  Not only deciding if you're approved, but your interest rates which
  is how much you pay.

1. For example, when buying a car, if you have good
   credit, your interest rate is lower, and as a result the monthly and
   total payment is much cheaper.
2. Landlords may check your credit score to see if they'll let you
   rent an apartment.
3. Employers can check credit scores as a part of their background check.
4. Utility companies can check your credit score to decide whether
   to make you pay a deposit when you sign up for their service.

# How to check credit score:

1. Many credit card companies allow you to check your
   account or you may have to contact the company.
2. Use a credit score website or app such as Credit Karma.
3. You can purchase your credit score from one of the three
   major bureaus, note your score may differ slightly since
   each has its own way of calculating it.
4. You can request a free copy of a credit report once per year.  
   It won't have your score but has info to allow you to roughly
   guess you score.

# Hard Inquiry vs Soft Inquiry:

- Checking your credit score on your own doesn't hurt your credit score. However
  when a creditor or lender checks it, that will affect your credit score.

1. Soft Inquiry (Soft credit check): Usually done by you or an authorized person like your
   employer. Checking your credit score this way doesn't affect it since you're not applying
   for credit. Can happen when you request a copy of your credit report or go to check your
   score.
2. Hard Inquiry (Hard Credit Check): Done by lenders to check your credit. Often happens
   when applying for a mortgage, loan, or credit card. Any situation where you're applying
   for credit from a lender. This will affect your score, by about 5 points, because you're applying for credit.

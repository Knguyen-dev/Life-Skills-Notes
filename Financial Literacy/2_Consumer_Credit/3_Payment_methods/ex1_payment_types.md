# Different types of payment methods

1. Cash: Used and accepted essentially everywhere. The drawbacks are that you have to physically carry it around, not really safe to carry it as you could lose it or get it stolen, and it's not the easiest to keep track of as your transactions aren't electronically recorded. The only evidence of your transactions will be a physical receipt.
2. Credit card: Card you use to spend borrowed money from the bank or credit card company.
3. Debit card: Card you use to spend money that you own in your bank/checking account.
4. Rent-to-Own: Consumers can take home items like furniture, and make weekly or monthly payments on them until they're paid off. Note that consumers will typically end up paying a lot more than they would if they bought it outright.
5. Store credit: Lets consumers buy items and pay for them over time. Consumers enter an installment plan, where they do something such as make monthly payments for an item. For example, buying a TV that offer store credit, you can pay for it in 12 monthly installments. Could offer zero-interest financing, which means monthly payments won't have interest on them, so it's the same as buying it outright. Though there will be some extra fine-print conditions to fulfill this.
6. Installment Agreements: Consumers buy something and pay it overtime, in a series of payments called installments. You agree to make payments, typically monthly, over a set period of itme with interest.
7. Layaway: Customers reserve an item they want to buy and make payments towards the total cost of that item over time. Usually you make an initial deposit, which indicates you're financially invested and so they'll reserve the item for you. Once you're money contributed reaches the total amount you can have the item.

# Pros and Cons of main 3 payment types:
1. Credit: Good security, builds credit, and sometimes there are rewards. However, you could get hit with interest and fall into debt if you're not responsible.
2. Cash: Good for any physical store. Just need to keep receipt or note down what you bought in your budget app since it's not electronically recorded by any of your bank accounts.
3. Debit: You're using your own cash, but you're very susceptible to fraud.
- In my opinion, always use credit card or cash. At least in those ways you're most protected from digital fraud. Using your debit card online is too risky, and even in person it's risky due to card readers.

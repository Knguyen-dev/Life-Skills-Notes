# Vocabulary and things to look out for
- There's a lot of vocabulary and things you should be aware of when picking and choosing a credit card.

1. APR/Interest Rate: The 'annual percentage rate' is the interest rate you'll be charged on any unpaid balance. Though it's annual, any unpaid balance is charged interest monthly. For example, if APR is 18%, then the monthly interest is 1.5%. So for every month that you didn't pay off your credit card balance, the amount you'll have to pay increases by 1.5%. This is compound interest. The lower your apr, the better the deal, however you'll need good credit to get a low APR.
2. Annual fee: A yearly fee you pay for simply having hte card. Some cards have them others don't.
3. Rewards and Perks: Some cards give you rewards for using the card in the form of points, cash back, etc. It depends on the card and company really.
4. Credit Limit: The maximum amount you're allowed to spend on the card. It's possible to go over, but you're card will usually be  declined. If you're approved you'll incur fees and a higher interest rate usually.
5. Variable rate information: Some cards have variable APRs so the interest rate can change overtime. So 
  you'll get info about this if it's relevant to your card.
6. Grace period: Amount of time you have to pay your bill in full until you're charged interest.
7. Minimum finance charge: Smallest amount of interest you can be charged if you don't pay your credit card bill in full.
8. Transaction fee: Some cards may charge small fees for different types of transactions.
9. Penalty fees: Fees you'll be charged if you miss a payment, go over your credit limit, etc.
10. Cash Advances: The idea of withdrawing money from your credit card to get cash, which of course counts as spending towards the credit limit. You could do a cash advance at a bank or atm, but also note that other transactions such as transferring money via Paypal or Venmo with your card could also be considerd a cash advance as well. Cash advances aren't recommended as they have high interest rates, fees, etc. Also they have no grace period, so you need to pay them
immediately so they don't accrue interest.
11. Balance transfer: The act of moving the credit card balance, the money owed on a credit card, to another credit card. You'll see balance transfer APR which is just the APR applied to the credit card balance you're transferring. This can be good for people who want to transfer their high APR balance to a promising promotional 0% APR deal or at least an offer with a lower APR than they currently have.
Though you'll usually pay a balance transfer fee for doing it, which will be a percentage of the balance being transferred.
12. Minimum payment: The smallest amount a cardholder is required to pay on their card balance each billing cycle. So if they can't pay in full, they must at least pay this minimum amount (usually a percentage). If they don't pay this amount they'll be hit with late fees and penalty APR.
We'll talk about penalty APR in our Schumer box exercise.

# Where to find information about a credit card:
- A Schumer box is a chart or table that contains all the information about a credit card. It is legally required by companies to be sent or shown to you. Typically, it should be easy to find for any credit card.

# Schumer Box exercise:
- Let's look at NerdWallet's Schumer Box, and let's
  analyze it to see what's happening with the credit card.
1. APR: We have 3 main APRs based on credit score. Also this is a variable APR based on 'Prime rate', which is the APR rate for the most credit-trustworthy cardholders.
2. APR for transfers: Here it lists the APR that'll be applied on the credit card balance you transfer from one card card to another. Again it's a variable rate.
3. APR for cash advances: The interest rate when you do a cash advance. This is high because it's seen as risky and not recommended move. Remember this interest will typically accrue immediately!
4. Penalty APR: APR that's applied when you make a late payment, which is caused when you fail to pay the minimum amount before each billing cycle. 
5. Paying interest: You have 25 days after the close of a billing cycle to pay your balance in full. They'll charge interest if there's remaining balance after the due date obviously. Finally they list that for cash advances, they start accruing interest from the transaction date. So every day after, the cash advance balance accrues interest via the cash advance APR.
6. Minimum interest charge: You aren't charged less than 50 cents on interest.


# Billing Cycle and Grace Period in Depth:
- Let's say the billing cycle is from the 1st to 31st of each month. You get a statement at the start if each month or cycle, detailing all of the credit card transitions you've made in the previous month.

1. So on May 2nd you make a $50 purchase and on May 15th you make a $25 purchase.
2. On June 1st, you receive the statement showing how much you have to pay because of the previous month.
3. You have a 25 day grace period, so 25 days after the previous billing cycle ended, is the time you get to pay your bill before interest accrues, so pay by June 26th. You have to pay the 'statement balance' from May.
4. Now when you're making purchases with your credit card in June, you are accumulating 
  a new statement balance, which you will pay 25 days after the current billing cycle ends.

- Example 2: Billing cycle ends on April 3rd, and payment is due on April 28th. You buy make a $300 purchase on April 1st. 

1. Billing cycle hasn't ended so that balance will be a part of the statement for the current billing cycle.
2. You'll get your statement on April 3rd, which will be the start of new billing cycle. This statement contains amount you accumulated over previous billing cycle, and that of which you need to pay.
3. You have 25 days grace period to pay off the statement in full, which includes your $300 purchase since remember that was a part of the last billing cycle.


# Daily interest and carrying a balance:
- If you only partially pay the statement balance before the end of the grace period, you're carrying a balance. The balance will start accruing interest immediately, and daily! If you make new purchases without paying off your carried balance first, your new purchases will start accruing interest with no grace period! This is how people lose money as, even if you're carrying $3 worth of credit card balance over to the new billing cycle, if you forget and purchase $300 worth of stuff, now that's $303 accruing interest daily until you pay it off. Main lesson is, if
you're carrying a balance, pay it off first before using your credit card to avoid any new purchases accruing interest.

# Credit Card
- A type of payment card that lets you borrow money from a
  bank or credit card company. We use this borrowed money to 
  buy things, and we agree to pay this money back later.
  The amount of money we borrowed and haven't paid back is a 
  credit card's balance. So a credit card is borrowing money, 
  while a debit card, is using your money. 

# Why do you need a credit card:
1. Helps you build credit, which is important if you want to mortgage property or take out a loan.
2. Some come with rewards or cash back, allowing you to get money back for spending money like how you usually do.

# Why you might not need a credit card:
1. Easy to overspend and go into debt if you can't pay it off.
2. If you don't pay the bill on time, it lowers your credit score. 
3. Also if you don't pay it all on time, then the balance of your credit 
  card receives interest, meaning you have to pay more the next month.

# Fraud Protection:
- If you're not using cash, then it's recommended to use a credit card for your 
  purchases over a debit card. Let's say you only use your credit card on the 
  internet, and somehow your card information got hacked. Here's how both would go down:
1. Debit Card: You're fighting one your own to get your money back.
  Typically unsuccessful, so you have to take the loss.
2. Credit Card: Someone spent on your credit card, but that's not your money, 
  that's the bank's money. If you just make a call to tell them it's 
  fraud, then the bank or card company is the one that deals with it, not you. 
- We'll cover this a lot later in the fraud section, but it's a lot safer to use your credit card, when swiping online or shopping in store. So a good tip is just use credit whenever possible, cash if you're trying to 
have a good credit utilization ratio, and only your debit card at an ATM you know is secure. 

# Types of Credit Cards:
1. Standard credit cards: They have a credit limit, which is how much you can spend. You need to pay the full amount back every month, or you'll get hit with interest. Sometimes there's an annual service fee.
2. Reward credit cards: You get rewards such as points, cash back, etc. for using them. However, they typically have higher interest rates or fees, and have more conditions. They're good for people who can responsibly pay off their credit card balance every month.
3. Secure credit cards: Deposit some money first, say $300. Then you have that same amount as a credit limit. Then you can use it and pay off the balance you use like a normal credit card. Then once you're done using your card, you get your deposit back. Secure cards are for people with bad or no credit, and so that deposit is in case if you don't pay back your credit card, the bank has your money and doesn't lose any money by paying for your stuff with their money.
4. Student credit cards: For college or university students. No lower credit limit and interest rates than standard cards. It's good for helping them build a good credit history while they're in school.
5. Business credit cards: For business owners or employees to pay business-related expenses such as traveling, supplies, etc. High credit limit and interest rates compared to standard cards. They could have extra benefits, and it helps separate personal and business spending.
6. Store credit cards: Issued to specific retailers such as department stores, gas stations, online shops, etc.
and they can be only used at these retailers. An example is Target's REDcard Credit card, a credit card you can only use at target. They offer benefits when you shop and use them at those specific stores.


# Protect sensitive card information:
- Sensitive card information you keep secret to help prevent fraud and others using your card without your authorization:
1. Card number: Primary sequence of digits on your card.
2. Expiration date: When your card expires or isn't valid anymore
3. CVV/CVC code: the Card verification value/code is a 3 digit number.
4. PIN: A sequence of digits that you type in everytime you want to confirm usage of your credit card. Used when swiping at a card reader, atm, or similar transactions.

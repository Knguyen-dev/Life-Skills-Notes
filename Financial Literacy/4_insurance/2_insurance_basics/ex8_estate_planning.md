# Estate Planning

## What is estate planning?
Process of arranging and managing your money, properties, and permissions for the future. In the event you pass away, we need to specify where this stuff goes and who it goes to.

As a result, at least you can know that your stuff goes to your family or people yo ucare about, even after you're gone.

## Goals of estate planning
1. Taking care of loved ones.
2. Deciding who gets your belongings
3. Choosing someone to make decisions for you. You can pick someone you trust to handle the affairs. They have control over your property and stuff, and have the authority to distribute them after you're gone.e This is called a 'trust' because we trust this person to carry out our wishes and make the best choices, ones that we can't make ourselves.
4. Expressing stuff such as medical treatment during your final days, your funeral arrangments, or how you want your stuff divided.

## What happens if there is no estate plan
- Family is left guessing about funeral, and other wishes. Who will look after your children, assuming you're a single parent. How is property and money divided? This can then cause disagreements between family members, destroying relationships and whatnot.
- If there's no estate plan, assets must be divided via a probate. A probate is a legal process that happens after someone dies. It involves lawyers, judges, and anyone affected by the person's death. The main goal of a probate is dividing the person's property. This can be very expensive and time-consuming, and having an estate plan can avoid this and make the lives of your family easier after your passing.

## Key terms in estate planning
- Will: A legal document that says who gets your stuff when you die. This is one method for estate planning as it's a very simple and straightforward document of how your assets are distributed after you die. They're typically less expensive and are suitable for simpler estate planning needs.
- Executor: The person who makes sure your will is followed.
- Trust: A trust is a legal arrangement where one person (the "trustor") transfers ownership of their assets to another person or entity (the "trustee"), who manages those assets for the benefit of others (the "beneficiaries"). The trustee follows instructions laid out in a trust document, which specifies how the assets should be managed and distributed. To set up a trust, the trustor transfers ownership of assets to the trust, which means the assets are now owned by the trust, not the trustor. However, the trustor retains control over the assets and can amend or revoke the trust during their lifetime. Trusts are commonly used in estate planning to ensure that assets are distributed according to the trustor's wishes. Trusts can also provide benefits such as avoiding probate, maintaining privacy, and providing for the management of assets if the trustor becomes incapacitated.
- Beneficiary: A person who inherits your belongings from your will, trust, or life insurance.
- Healthcare proxy: Someone who makes medical decisions for you if you can't. 
- Probate: A court process that makes sure you will is followed and your debts are paid.
- Guardian: A person who takes care of your kids if you can't.
- Guardianship of a minor child: The legal responsibility of taking care of and making decisions for a child under the age of 18, if you are not able to do so. So a guardian receives this responsibility when someone is unsable to care for their minor child, whether due to death or something else.

### Estate planning example
Ali is a married father of two kids, and has a wife named Fatima. He wants to make sure that if he dies, then his family gets his belongings and are taken care of. Hree's his plan:

1. He sets up a trust, where Fatima is the trustee, alloiwng her to manage his property and assets on behalf of his children. 
2. Fatima is also a beneficiary in his will (she gets some stuff), and the executor, giving her the authority to ensure the will is carried out according to his wishes.
3. He names Fatima as his healthcare proxy, which means in the event that he can't make medical decisions for himself, she can make those decisions for him.
4. He selects his brother, Ibrahim, as the guardian of his children, in case something happens to both him and Fatima.
5. Ali knows that his will still needs to go through probate, but that's fine. This just indicates that maybe not all of his assets are held in his trust. If he has mroe time, he pay want to ensuer all assets are under his trust.

# Car Insurance
Provides financial protection for drivers in case of accidents, theft, and damage to their car. However it also covers things such as repairs, medical bills, and even legal fees, depending on the insurance chosen.

## What is car insurance?
Agreement where insurance company agrees to protect a vehicle from financial losses. This could be accident, theft, or other events involving a vehicle. In exchange, the vehicle owner pays a premium fee to the company. The same basic idea as other forms of insurance.

## Do i need car insurance?
1. It's legally required in most states. If you don't have insurance you could get a ticket and sometimes law enforcement will take away your car.
2. May protect you and others from the cost of repair, expensive lawsuits, and medical bills in the event of car accidents.
3. Can help repair or replace your car if it's simply stolen or damaged, not even involved in a car accident.

## Types of coverage

### Liability coverage
Covers the cost if you cause an accident and someone else get hurts or their property is damaged. It doesn't cover your own injuries or damages to your own car, but it helps pay for other people's stuff when it was your fault. This is a lot better than being forced to help pay for another person's medical bills and any other damages you caused.

### Collision coverage
Helps pay for repairs to your own car when it was damaged in an accident, regardless of who is at fault. This is only for collisions, so it doesn't cover damages from theft, vandalism, and other things.

### Comprehensive coverage
Helps pay for dmaage that isn't caused by a collision with another vehicle. So this covers theft, vandalism, hail, trees falling on your car, etc.

### Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage
If you're in an accident with someone who doesn't have enough insurance or none at all, this helps pay for your medical bills and car repairs. For example, let's say you get into an accident with someone like this. Yeah you'd probably get some money from your own insurance policy for medical bills, but it may not be enough. As well, the other person's insurance isn't good so it won't contribute much either. So this insurance just helps when that happens. However this insurance doesn't kick in when you're not fault for the accident, as it's designed to protect you when it was someone else's fault. Also, it won't pay for damages you caused.

### Medical payment (Medpay) coverage
Helps pay for your medical bills if you're injured in an accident, regardless of who is at fault. This doesn't cover property damage or other things, just the medical stuff for yourself.

## How much does car insurance cost?
It's influenced by various factors. Here are some:
1. Make, model, and year of your car: Different cars have different levels of risk and repair costs which will affect the insurance price. For example, a luxury sports car is likely going to have a higher premium than a family sedan due to the higher costs for repairing it, and also the greater likelihood of accidents due to the fact that it's a car made for speed. As well as this, due to how the car stands out, it could be targeted for theft and vandalism, which could affect your cost.
2. Age and gender: Statistically, younger drivers and male drivers tend to be in more accidents. Insurance companies use this information, and can charge higher rates for people who fit that profile. Though as you continue to earn trust by having a clean driving record, your insurance rates will decrease.
3. Driving history: If you have a good driving history, no tickets or accidents, it's going to be a lower cost because it's perceived that you're not likely to get into accidents, so the company isn't likely to payout for you. On the other hand, a person with a history of accidents and traffic violations is untrustworthy and is perceived to get into more accidents, so it's a higher premium. 
4. Your deductible: A higher deductible typically means a lower premium, and vice versa. 
5. Your coverage: The more coverage you want, the more you will have to pay. The bare minimum is typically liability insurance (the cheapest), but most of the time peole want coverage to pay for themselves as well, such as medical, collision, etc.
6. Geographical location: Where you live and drive can have an impact. Things such as local crime, weather, and the frequency of accidents in your region can influence the cost of your insurance.

## Choosing the best policy:
- Determine the minmium amount legally required. We want to make sure we're following the law.
- Consider your vehicle.
- Decide how much coverage you want, think about deductible and policy limits.
- Compare quotes from multiple insurance companies to see which deals are better and worse.
- Review and update your policy to see if it's still enough for you.


## Working through a real example
1. First determine the minimum amount of coverage that's legally required. So for some state, policy limits have a minimum of $25,000 per person for bodily injury, $50,000 per accident for bodily injury, and $10,000 for property damage.
2. Consider our vehicle. We're driving a used car worth around $4,000, for regular travel. So maybe pick a higher deductible to avoid paying an expensive premium for such a low-cost vehicle.
3. We really need the car, for work and school, so we'll need some coverage. Let's have collision and 'comprehensive' coverage for accidents and other unexpected damages not caused by accidents. Maybe since the car isn't worth that much, we make it so the policy limit for these isn't as much so we don't have to pay as much for the premium.
4. Finally we compares quotes from our different companies, and choose the best rates and coverage for us.

- NOTE 1: 
1. Per person for bodily injury: Min amount of coverage for each person who was injured. So here our policy must cover at least $25,000 for each person.
2. Per accident for bodily injury: total min amount of liability coverage for bodily injury. 
3. In this situation if 3 people are injured. If all 3 receive a maximum payment ($25,000), then the total paid for per bodily injury is $75,000. However the 'per-accident' limit is $50,000, so the total amount paid for bodily injury is capped at $50,000. So in the end the insurance company will only pay $50,000.

- NOTE 2: An insurance 'quote' is the estimated cost of our policy that an insurance agent or company calculated.

# Life Insurance
- Where the insured pays a regular premium to the company. In return, the insurance company will pay a certain amount of money, a death benefit, to the insured's beneficiaries, such as their family, when the insured dies. So as a result, you can have peace of mind knowing after your death, your family will be taken care of financially.

# Who needs life insurance:
- People who have dependents, which are just others that financially rely on them. If you don't have dependents, you probably don't need life insurance as you don't really have anyone that you want to leave money to after your death.
1. Parents with young children.
2. People who have a lot of debt.
3. People who have others that depend on them.
4. People who want to leave stuff behind for loved ones.


# Term life vs whole life:
- These are two different policy types on life insurance. 
1. Term life: Covers you for specific time frame, as low as 5 years or as high as 30 years. You'd have to die within a specific time frame for the company to pay a death benefit. Usually the premiums are lower in the beginning.
2. Whole life: Life insurance that covers your whole life. Regardless of when, after you die they will pay a death benefit to your beneficiaries. Typically more expensive, and you build 'cash' value. Essentially a portion of money that grows with interest that you can withdraw or borrow from. Usually premiums are higher in the beginning, which help build that cash value.

- NOTE: The idea is that with whole life, you don't have to worry about having to apply for insurance again and potentially getting rejected. Maybe your health changed, making you uninsurable, maybe you have a dangerous job now, etc.


# Idea of 'insurable' and life insurance:
- If you're insurable, the company is willing to enroll you in their life insurance policy. While health insurance companies can't refuse service, life insurance companies can. Based on your age, your health, what you do, etc. You can also become uninsurable if you develop health issues, change jobs, etc. 

- NOTE: They charge less for younger people, as you're less likely to get sick, and die. The younger you enroll, the better for you. If you're healthy, it'll probably be cheaper. If you have a dangerous job (firefighter), you'll probably pay a little more.

# Takeaway:
- If you need life insurance, know that the higher the payout, the more costly the premium. Find a good balance between having a good payout that protects your family, but not so high as it's actively burdening you.

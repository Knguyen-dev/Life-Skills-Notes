# Health Insurance:
- Help us pay for medical care. Without it we'd have to pay for the entire cost of a medical bill, which is extremely expensive. 

# Why it's needed:
- Imagine you get sick, go to the hospital, and get a medical bill. Medical bills could be hundreds or thousands of dollars. But with health insurance, you simply pay a monthly premium, and the insurance companies help cover the costs.

# Health care challenges and the Affordable Care Act:
- Essentially, the U.S. healthcare system has problems, and costs for health care are rising, and so premiums are rising. However there have been some solutions.
- Affordable Care Act (ACA): A U.S. law that tries to address some health care issues. Here's what it does
1. Individual Mandate: Though it was eliminated in 2018, it said most people had to have health care of pay a fine. Know that some states have their own individual mandate laws with associated penalties.
2. Health insurance exchanges: There are online marketplaces where people can compare and buy health insurance plans.
3. Subsidies: Government helps pay the health insurance premiums for some people.
4. Essential health benefits: All insurance plans have to cover certain services such as doctor visits and prescription medication.
5. Insurance companies can't refuse to cover people or charge them more due to them having health problems.

# Types of health insurance: 

1. Individual Plan: A policy you buy on your own. You pay the premium each month, rather than having the government or a company help you pay it. Bought on exchanges created by ACA or bought directly from companeis, and the benefit is the freedom of it.
2. Employer-provided plan: Many get their health-insurance through their jobs, as companies pay part of the premium, making it more affordable. Some drawbacks could be you could be limited to doctors and covered services. Also you likely lose the plan once you leave that job.
3. Government-provided plan: Government funded plans that help people pay for medical care. Of course, you must meet certain conditions to met these plans. Some examples are Medicaid, Medicare, veterans' healthcare, etc.

# Review of heath insurance terms:
1. Premiums: How much you pay out of pocket each month.
2. Deductible: How much you have to pay before insurance starts helping you out.
3. Co-pay/co-insurance: How much you have to pay each time you save a service covered by the policy. Such as visiting the doctor or getting a prescription. Remember, the co-pay you pay would be a small part as the insurance company pays a large part of the portion of how much that service costed.
4. Network: The 'favorite' doctors and hospitals for the insurance plan's 'network'. So those doctors and hospitals partnered up with the insurance company to provide care at lower costs, so it's cheaper to go to them.
5. Out-of-pocket maximum: The most you'll have to pay out-of-pocket in a year for medical expenses.


# Health care examples and exercises:
1. You're under an employer provided plan. The employer pays most of the premium, you have small copay, and your insurance would cover most of the medical bill if you ever get sick.
2. You're in an individual plan, with a reasonable premium, but a $5000 deductible. So you'll have to pay $5000 out-of-pocket until insurance starts helping out.
3. You're under a government-provided plan, Medicaid. You don't pay a premium and have a low deductible. This is because you're low income. However, not all doctors accept Medicaid, so you may have to travel a little further to get to one that does.

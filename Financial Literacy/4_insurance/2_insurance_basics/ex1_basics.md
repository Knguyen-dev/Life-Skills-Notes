# Insurance
- Situation: Let's say you have a $10,000 car. You don't have another $10,000 to replace the car if something bad were to happen to it, so you go to an insurance company to insure it. You'll pay some monthly fee, say $20, but in return if something bad happens to your car, the insurance company will pay a lot of money to cover the costs of the car. 
- Insurance: A contract where you, a policyholder, receives financial protection or reinbursement against losses. That protection coming from the insurance company, which is the policy. Some examples are car, house, healthcare, or life insurance. 

- NOTE: How does insurance make money, when you're paying so little a year, but then they'll cover expensive costs such as medical bills, cars, etc.? Well it's the statistics, so let's say a person has a 1% chance to get in a car crash in a year. There's a 1% chance they'll have to pay you, and know that millions of others are paying insurance as well. So they're raking in lots of money, and their statisticians know that they'll probably only have to pay back like 1% of that each year.


# Insurance Terminology:
1. Premium: What you're paying in order to receive that insurance, typically a monthly cost. For example, if you're paying $200 a month, that's your premium.
2. Deductible: Amount of money the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurance company steps in and pays. For example, you have a $5000 deductible for medical insurance. Your first two medical bills are $2000, and $3000 each. You'll the first one out of pocket because you haven't reached the $5000 limit yet. Now the second one you also have out of pocket since you've only paid $2000, in medical costs, out of that $5000. Now for any bill after, insurance will kick in because you've reached the $5000 deductible or threshold, so it'll help pay for the majority of your stuff. 
3. Policy Limit: The maximum amount of money that the insurance company can pay out. For example, let's say the policy limit is $75,000 on your medical insurance. If your medical bill is $100,000, your medical insurance can only help you out with that $75,000. You'll need to pay the remaining $25,000 out of your own pockets.
4. Copay: Fixed amount that the insured must pay each time they receive a service that's covered by their insurance. So like for a medical check up, you pay something like $20 copay, but the insurance contributes $300 to that $320 checkup. 
5. Claim: When you ask the insurance company to help pay for a covered lost. You are making a claim, to claim your insurance money.
6. Benefit: Amount of money the insurance company agrees to pay when you make a claim. 

- NOTE: With a high deductible, you'll usually get a lower premium. That's the trade off. It sends the message that you shouldn't be using insurance as a service too much. The insurance is only

# Insurance terms example:
1 Let's say your deductible is $1000 on a car, and you get into an accident that costs $3000 to repair your car. Well you file a claim to your insurance company, as you've been paying this premium, it's time for them to pay out. You pay your portion of the car repair, which will be the deductible's amount of $1000, and then the insurance company pays the remaining $2000.
2. Some home insurance policy has a policy limit of $400,000. So if the house is damaged somehow, the company will only pay up to $400,000.
3. A health insurance policy has a co-pay of $30 for specialists visits. So each time a person visits a specialist, they pay $30 out of pocket whilst the insurance company covers the rest of the visit.
4. A life insurance policy has a premium of $300 a year. So you'll pay $300 a year to keep that policy active and get that coverage.
# Is insurance worth it and takeaway:
- Most insurance is required by law. Also even if it feels like you're paying money to avoid a small chance, it's a lot easier on you financially. Accidents can happen, and it's easier to pay $300 a year for protection, than to pay another $500,000 out of pocket for a new house since your old one burned down 5 years in.

# Supplemental Insurance
These are 'supplemental' or 'extra' insurances after the main ones. 


## Extended warranties
A warranty is a promise from a seller to repair or replace a product within a timeframe after purchase. 

An extended warranty, is an optional agreement that extends the warranty's coverage to a longer period of time. You could save money if the item breaks, however the thing is you may never need the extended warranty. When choosing think about how likely it is to break, how expensive would it be to fix or replace, and even if you can afford to pay for a repair or replacement without the warranty.

## Mortgage protection
This insurance pays off your mortage if you pass away, so that your family doesn't have to worry about making payments. Cost depends on age, health, and amount on your mortgage, but it could simply be a few hundred dollars annually.

The advantage is ensuring your loved ones won't worry about the mortgage after you're gone. However you may not even need it.

## Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) insurance
Pays you or your family if you die or get seriously injured in an accident. Good thing is that it can provide help, but it may not be necessary if you have life insurance.

## Car loan payoff coverage:
Pays off your car loan if your car is totaled (completely destroyed) in an accident or stolen. Might not be necessary if you have enough savings to pay the car loan, or if you have car insurance that has this type of coverage.

## Debt cancellation coverage:
Cancels your debt, like a credit card balance or personal loan, if soemthing bad happens to you such as losing your job or getting sick. Cost depends on your debt and the type of unfortunate event that triggers the cancellation.

Downside is that it may not be necessary for you to pay the cost if you already have enough savings or disability insurance to cover your debt payments.

## Credit life coverage
Pays off debt if you pass away. Usually offered with credit cards and some loans. However, this may not be necessary if you have life insurance or something similar.

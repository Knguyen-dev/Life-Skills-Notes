# Property Insurance:
- Helps protect your investments or belongings from unexpected events. Can cover of costs of repairing or replacing damaged items as well. 


# Homeowner's vs renter's insurance:
- Homeowner's insurance: For people who own a house. It usually covers the building, other structures on the property such as a shed or play set, and then the homeowner's personal belongings. So if like in a fire, everything is destroyed. The insurance helps cover the costs of your house and all of your other stuff that was destroyed/damaged.
- Renter's insurance: Only covers renter's personal property, not the building itself that's being rented. Designed to specifically help the renter for covering damaged goods, and giving them liability insurance coverage.


# Scenarios when property insurance covers?
- Here are some common events where property insurance will cover you:
1. Fires: Can be caused by accidents such as faulty wiring, lighning strikes, or other natural/unexpected events.
2. Theft: Such as a break-in, robbery, or any other time someone steals your stuff.
3. Vandalism: Covers intentioanl damage done to your property by another person.
4. Storms or tornadoes.

# Types of coverage:
1. Structural: Damage done to actual buildings or structures of your home. Such as when a tree falls on your house during a storm, structural coverage handles helping you pay the repairs.
2. Personal property: Covers items in your home such as furniture, electronics, clothes, etc. An example is that if someone breaks in your home and takes you laptop, personal property coverage would help replace it.
3. Liability: Protects you in case someone is injured on your property. Such as if someone falls on your icy-sidewalk, the liability coverage helps pay for thier medical bills and legal fees if they want to sue.

# Costs of property insurance:
- Depends on the situation as you could be as low as $600, while on the other end it's over $2000. If you live in an small house, but in an area with high risk of natural disasters, then it could be $800 annually. However if it was a larger house in the same place, it'll increase to over $2000 possibly. Here are some factors that affect cost:

1. Location: May be more expensive if you live in a place with higher risk for natural disasters.
2. Home value: The more expensive your home, the higher the premium. Of course this makes sense since it would cost more to replace if it were damaged or destroyed.
3. Deductible: Choosing a higher deductible means your premium will be lower. Of course you'll pay more out of pocket before insurance helps out.
4. Coverage limits: The more coverage you want, the higher the cost. If you want to cover $100,000 worth of belongings, it'll be more expensive than if you only wanted to cover $50,000 worth of stuff.

# Comparing policies and reviewing terms:
1. Replacement cost: Covers costs to replace damaged items with new ones, without considering how they've depreciated in value. So if your 5-year old tv was stolen, this would pay for a brand new TV of similar quailty.
2. Actual cash value (ACV): Takes depreciation into account, meaning covers the cost minus how much it decreased in value over time. So if your 5-year old tv was stolen, it pays for a TV with similar age and condition.
3. Liability: Proects you in case someone's injured on your property.
4. Personal property: Covers belongings inside your home or apartment.
5. Additional living expenses: If your home or apartmnet becomes uninhabitable due to an event, this just helps cover the cost for temporary housing and other living expenses.


# Property insurance exercises:

1. A fire breaks out and damages your stove and cabinets. If you have replacement cost coverage, it pays for a new stove and cabinets. With ACV, it pays for a stove or cabinet in similar age and condition.

2. A thief takes you laptop and jewelry, so personal property coverage helps replace them, up to the policy limit of course.

3. A friend slips on the bathroom floor of you house and breaks their arm. Your liability coverage helps pay for their medical fees, and legal fees if they want to sue you.

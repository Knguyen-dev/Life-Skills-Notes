# How do you balance your budget

- Don't panic when any of your budgets (needs, wants, savings) are
  in the negative. When you have a negative balance, your income wasn't enough to cover expenses so try to increase income, reduce expenses, or do both.

# Increasing Income:

- Finding is the more common way to do this, but there are a lot more pathways you can take:

1. Ask for a raise or more hours
2. Look for side jobs such as babysitting, mowing lawns, etc.
3. Sell things you don't use or need anymore such as clothes, books, toys, etc.
4. For occasions, don't be shy to simply ask for money instead of gifts. This could actually make it easier on the other guy.

# Reducing Expenses:

- Fixed Expenses: Expenses that are pre-determined by somebody other than yourself, such as a bank, company, etc. Changing these will involve negotiations that don't always work out. Examples are rent, bank fees, etc.
- Variable Expenses: Expenses that you're in control of such as groceries, utilities, shopping, etc. You can more easily change these and reduce them as you see fit.

# Ways to save:

1. Compare prices and look for discounts or coupons before you commit to buying something.
2. Try not to impulse buy. Really think if you actually need it or even planned to buy it in the first place. Impulse buying messes up your budgeting plans.
3. Use less utilities such as water, electricity, and gas to make utilities cheaper.
4. Reuse old items instead of buying new ones. If it isn't broken, then you probably don't need the newest phone.
5. Eat your own food instead of buying it outside.
6. Choose free or low-cost activities for entertainment

# Shifting funds:

- Of course remember you can always try to use extra
  money from other categories to offset some costs. However this is not recommended as it's a short term fix, and ideal thing you need to do is figure out the main causes of your negative balance in a category.

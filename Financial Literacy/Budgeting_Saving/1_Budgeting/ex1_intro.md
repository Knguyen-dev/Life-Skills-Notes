# Budgeting

- Budget: A plan to help you manage money. Allowing you to
  effectively use your money to reach goals, but also use it
  in a wise way. Below are some of the benefits of budgeting.

1. Track income and expenses: Income is the money
   we receive like allowance, jobs, etc. Whilst expenses will be the money we use
   to spend on different things such as food, bills, etc.

2. Creating and Achieving goals: Goals or the things we want to
   use our money on in this case. Like saving up for a vacation, gift, etc.

3. Avoid or Reduce Debt: Debt is money that we owe to someone else.
   Such as a bank, store, or friend. If left unpaid it gains interest,
   increasing the amount you have to pay, and also there are extra fees.
   This not only hurts us financially, and causes problems. A budget
   helps us avoid spending or borrowing money recklessly, keeping us
   out or trouble

# Ways to Budget:

1. Pencil and paper: We write down income and expenses, and subtract our
   income from our expenses to see the amount of money we have left. Divide
   your expenses into needs, wants, savings, etc. and decide which is most important.
2. Spreadsheet: Spreadsheet software such as Excel, Google Sheets, or Numbers makes
   it easy to create a budget spreadsheet. Enter income and expenses in different
   cells and then use formulas to find the amount of money you have left. Then
   you can start allocating your money into what you want to spend it on.
3. Apps like Empower, YNAB, Mobills, Rocket Money, Nerd Wallet, Mint Mobile, etc.
   can connect to your bank account, cards, and other financial accounts to update your income and expenses.
   These make it easier as you don't have to do much setup, rather you're thinking about
   what you need to allocate funds to.

# Budgeting and the 50/30/20 rule:

- 50/30/20 Rule: Divides your money into three categories needs, wants, and savings.
  You spend 50% of needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings. First to get started you
  need to take some steps.

1. Know your income: Add up your total sources of income. Right now let's add up how
   much income we have every month. This is the starting point.
2. Calculate needs: Calculate the total cost for your needs such as rent, utilities,
   food, insurance, etc. Do yourIncome multiplied by 0.5 = total money budgeted for needs. For example if
   your income is $2,000 monthly, do 0.5 multiplied by 2000 = 1000, meaning your needs budget is $1000.
   So try to stay under $1000 each month for spending on your needs.
3. Calculate wants: Wants are just desires such as hobbies, entertainment, etc. Do
   your_income multiplied by 0.3 = total money budgeted for wants. Since our income is $2000, 30% of
   that is only $600, so we try to stay under $600 on monthly spending on our wants.
4. Calculate savings: The money we put aside for future goals such as emergency funds,
   retirement accounts, college money, etc. This is 20% of our monthly income so we should
   be saving about $400 each month.
5. Record actual spending: Get your latest bank statement and
   analyze what you spent and we add up the totals for needs, wants, and savings.
   For example, if you spent $200 on the utilities, put $200 under needs section.
   If you spent $25 on movie tickets, put that down in the wants section.
6. Compare actual expenses to budget: Subtract your respective expenses
   from each of the budgets you calculated. Earlier we said $1000 for the needs section, so
   do $1000 - money spent on needs, and record the result. Do this for your other two sections.If we're zero or positive, that's good as we're spending as expected and may have extra money. Else if we're negative, that means we are spending more than we planned, which is bad.
7. Adjusting: If any of our columns are negative, then we adjust. We can use extra money from our other categories and move them to offset the cost. If there's no extra money we need to find a way to reduce our expenses or increase our income. Finally, if our budget
   is positive, we need to decide what to do with it. We could spend it on wants, but the more savings we can do, the better.

# Going through the budget worksheet

1. In first sheet, we write down our needs and wants. Then
   After we subtract those total costs from our after tax-income, we
   get the amount of money we should be saving. To ensure that we
   abide by that 50/30/20 rule, we thought about ways we could reduce
   our expenses in the 'needs' category. Then after a bit we were
   able to get needs ot about 49%, abiding by our rules and actually
   giving us 24% savings instead of 20%. So it's about listing what
   we have down, and then making estimates about what we can do. That's
   the gameplan.

2. In our second sheet we actually use a template. Here we still
   use the 50/30/20 rule. Again we always start by looking
   through our bank statements to see our purchases and what we're
   actually spending our money on. Then we can start recording stuff.

# NOTE:

1. After tax income is the money that's actually going to our bank
   account, so the money we actually have. If you contribute an amount
   of money towards your pension, such as $200, instead of subtracting
   that from our income amount, add it back in so include it. Right now
   just think of a pension as paying the future you, we'll learn about it
   later.
2. The 50/30/20 rule came about in the sometime in the 2000s, during a different economic era.
   Now lots of things have changed. Does that make the rule useless? No, the rule has always been just a template
   or guideline for a general use case, but you will always likely tweak
   some of the percentages to your own unique circumstance.
3. Of course while spending, you can try to keep stuff in mind, but if it's your first
   month, then obviously don't worry, you weren't going to predict our percentages.
   At the end of the month, always reflect on how you've managed your money, what could have been different,
   are there any bills or loose ends you need to tie up, etc. If you're spending too much in
   the "wants", maybe you should drop stuff, or if you spent too little in the "wants" then
   hey some of that should go to savings.

# Automation:

- Automate your tasks with the help of your bank to reduce friction and work.

1. Recommended that we setup direct debit so that our bills are paid automatically.
   We don't want friction such as forgetting, being reminded, having to remember password,
   and logging in to pay bills. Simplify this with automation.
2. Setup automatic transfers from your bank account where you
   get paid, to a savings account. So that everytime you get paid,
   a percentage of that pay is automatically saved into that savings
   account.
3. Setup direct deposit, allowing you to get paid electronically through
   your bank account than through a check or physical form of payment.
4. If you have large saving goals. It's recommended we have separate funds
   for each goal. A house, a car, or a vacation fund, as it could be a lot clearer.

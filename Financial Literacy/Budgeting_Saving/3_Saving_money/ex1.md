# About Saving Money

- When we save money we are working towards those future goals
  or casting a safety net in case of emergencies or rainy days.

# How to save money

- Of course after calculating the budgets for your needs and wants, make
  sure you're meeting the budget of at least saving 20% of your income every month.
  Setup automation so that a percentage of every paycheck is deposited into
  your savings account. As a result you don't even have to think about it.
  This is likely the most efficient way, and of course set it up so that
  you're getting paid via direct deposit, which makes the whole thing easier.

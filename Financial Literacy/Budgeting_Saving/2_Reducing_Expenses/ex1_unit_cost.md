# Unit Cost:

- Situation: What's the better deal, a 16 oz shampoo bottle costs $4 or a
  35oz bottle that costs $7? To help us, we can calculate unit cost, or cost per
  unit of product.

1. $4 / 16oz = $0.25 per ounce
2. $7 / 35oz = $0.20 per ounce;
3. As a result, we can see the larger bottle has a cheaper
   unit cost because we're buying ounces of shampoo at a cheaper cost.
   In this case, it is the better deal and this is
   often the case for the larger that the larger containers
   have a cheaper unit price.

- Per Unit Pricing: Tells you how much we're paying per ounce, per pound,
  per item of stuff. And paying attention to unit pricing can help us
  find better deals when we're shopping for items. Note that most
  stores have already listed the per unit pricing to make it easier.

- NOTE: When relying on per unit pricing, make sure that when you
  buy a large container of something that you'll actually use the product or have
  space for it. Like, of course the 36 mega pack of paper towels is probably
  a couple cents cheaper when looking at unit price, but you may not need
  that much. Or the 24 inch pizza, which is somehow 0.25 cents cheaper
  than the regular pizza. Is it really the better deal if I'm spending
  10 more dollars on something I'm not going to finish? Just keep that
  common sense and moderation in mind.s

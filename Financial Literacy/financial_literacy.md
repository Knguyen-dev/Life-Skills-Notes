# Financial Literacy Notes

- Notes about understanding various finance related topics.
  At the end you should be able to:

1. Understand basic financial concepts
2. Develop good budgeting and money management habits
3. Know how to invest money wisely
4. Feel confident in making informed financial decisions.

- NOTE:

1. Besides these notes, we're going to leave the learning resources for
   each section in this markdown file. This allows for you to learn from
   our notes, but also learn direct from where we got the information.

2. Mainly these notes and info is going be taken from Khan Academy's
   financial literacy course, but we'll try to incorporate supplementary
   videos to refine the information if needed. So we'll list the khan academy
   course at the top, but we'll also list the additional resources for each
   section besides that course.

# Planning for retirement

## Why do we plan for retirement?
Imagine working for 30 years, receiving a paycheck and income. Now you retire and the paycheck stops, how do we get money to pay for day-to-day expenses for the next 30 years?

There's a government-insurance system called 'Social Security', where workers contribute a fraction of their salary in their working years. Then when they retire they receive benefits. However, this is often not enough to cover expenses for a comfortable , so we need to do better financial planning.

## Challenges and uncertainties
- Longer life expectancy: If you live longer, you'll need to have more money to cover your expenses longer. Plan on being reitred for about as many years as you were working.
- Rising care costs: Medical and long-term care is expensive. Plan on seeing a doctor more often and being healthy.
- Inflation: Cost of living will increase over time, so plan for how inflation is going to affect your retirement. The grocery bills today won't be the same when you retire.
- Changes in social policies and programs: Govenrment programs, like Social Security, can change over time. Try to stay informed, and be aware that these programs don't get the best funding.

## Estimating retirement expenses
- Housing: Rent, mortgage payments, property taxes, maintenance costs, insurance, utilities, etc.
- Food: Groceries or dining out.
- Transportation: Car expenses (maintenance, insurance, fuel), public transportation fares, etc.
- Health care: Health insurance (Medicare, etc), out of pocket medical services, and medicine.
- Entertainment: Costs for some hobbies, trips, and other activities. Things such as memberships, subscriptions, etc.
- Insurance and tadxes: Still have insurance policies (life or long-term care) and taxes on your retirement income and investments.

### Managing retirement expenses
There are many methods for estimating retirement expenses accurately:
- Replacement ratio: Calculated by estimating what percentage of your pre-retiremnt income you'll need during retirement (typically 70-80%). For example, we have a monthly income of $4000. Multiplied by 0.7 to get $2800 monthly. So on the low end we'd need $2800 for each month of retirement. Then with the high end (0.8), we can estimate that we need between $2800 and $3200 each month once we retire.
- Budgeting approach: Create a detailed budget for your retirement expenses, calculating all categories mentioned above.
- Online calculator: There's online software nowadays that help estimate our retirement expenses using information such as age, income, and savings.

## How to reduce retirement expense
- Downsize: Move to a smaller home or get rid of things you don't need, or sacrifice wants.
- Relocate: Moving ot a less expensive area definitely helps with housing, taxes, and other things.
- Work part-time: If you comfortable, working part time during retirement would help you earn extra income.
- Delay retirement: You may wait a few more years before retiring to save more money.

## Takeaway:
When you're working, you can contribute to a special 'retirement' savings, and this money will be affected by compound interest. Common retirement accounts are '401k' or 'Roth Ira', and we'll talk about that soon.

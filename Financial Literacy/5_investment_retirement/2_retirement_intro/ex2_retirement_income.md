## Social Security
A government controlled insurance system that financially benefits you when you retire. The idea is that with every paycheck, you contribute a certain amount to your social security plan. Then at the end, depending on how much monehy you put in, you reap the benefits.

## Employer Sponsored Retirement Plans (401k)
For some employers, they will have employer sponsored plans, which give benefits specialized benefits to employees. Often when you put money into the plan, the company will match a percentage of your contribution. An example of this is a 401k.

However you can put money into these on a pre-tax basis (up to maximum limit). For example, normally you make $10,000 but have a tax rate of 20%. You'll have to pay $2000 in taxes. However, for a 401k, you can put $10,000 in the plan and not have to pay taxes upfront. Then whilst in the plan you can do many different investments/actions with it. Then once you retire, only then will you pay taxes based on the amount accumulated in your 401k account. Here are some reasons why it's better that we waited on paying taxes:
1. Tax-deferred growth: By not paying upfront, our full $10,000 can be invested and grow over time (compound growth). This can insignificantly increase our savings.
2. Potentially lower tax bracket: When working you're typically on a higher tax bracket because you have higher income. But when retired, you have no job, lower income, so lower tax bracket. As a result, by deferring taxes until retirement, you may pay them at a lower rate. So in the end you can reduce the tax burden on your 

- Example of a 401(k) plan: Your employer does a full match (dollar for dollar) until you've contributed 3% of your salary. Then they match 50% of your contribution for the next 2%. And any after that is not matched. So we have a salary of $10,000. If we contribute $300 (3%), the employer contributes $300 (full match). Then we contribute $200 (remaining 2%), and the employer matches only 50% of it so they contribute $100. Then all the money after is not matched.

- NOTE: When you retire you'll likely have a large sum of money in your retirement plan account. However you don't have to withdraw the full amount all at once. You can choose to withdraw only waht you need, treating it like a bank account. However when you withdraw money from a traditional IRA or 401k, it's treated as ordinary income, so you will pay taxes on the amount you withdraw. So every withdrawal is subject to taxes. However, with a Roth 401k or IRA, since you paid those taxes upfront, when you retire and withdraw money, it isn't taxed.
- NOTE 2: Every 401(k) plan will have a different selection of things you can invest in chosen by your employer or fund providers. Typically just go for low fee investments and look for 'index funds' which are investments that track an entire index/market, essentially giving you a diverse portfolio of investments

### Considerations for 401(k)
You can withdraw as soon as you're 59.5 years old. If you're still working then, your income is going to be pretty high, so if you withdraw, you're going to be taxed pretty high. Essentially this would take away the major benefit of the 401(k). So if you don't mind working till or a little after this age, then retiring and going into a low tax bracket, then this is an attractive offer.

## Roth 401k
You pay the taxes upfront and contribute the after tax dollars to the investment. For example if you have $10,000 and need to pay $2500 in taxes, then the remaining $7500 is contributed to your roth 401(k), your money after taxes. Allowing investments to grow tax-free, meaning you won't pay taxes on your gains or dividends as long as you follow the rules. So you retire, you won't pay taxes on the amounts that you withdraw from your accumulated savings, so whatever you earn in a Roth 401(k), is what you get to keep.
- NOTE: Doesn't have an annual minimum required distribution like the Roth IRA, because your moeny was already taxed.

### 401k vs Roth 401k
- If your tax rate is higher now (high income), it'd make sense to contribute to a pre-tax (traditional) 401(k) over a Roth 401(k). This is because later in life, many live frugally and are in a lower tax bracket because they aren't earning as much income anymore, so the taxes they pay on their retirement earnings won't be as much as when they were working.
- Else, if your tax rate is lower now (low income), but you expect it to increase in retirement (higher income in retirement) then you may want to go for a Roth 401(k). This is because we expect the upfront taxes to be cheaper than the taxes in retirement, so we'll pay upfront and avoid taxes in retirement. However note that contributions to a Roth 401(k) will hit your budget harder because those after-taxes contributions will be more costly than a pre-tax contribution, because you are paying taxes upfront rather than pushing them off till later.

### Pros and cons of a 401(k)
- Pros: 
1. Employer Match: If your employer is matching a percentage of your contribution, you're getting free money.
2. High contribution limit: You're able to contribute more to your contribution plan annually, compared to an IRA. In 2024, the limit is $23,000 annually.
3. Regardless of which you pick, you're going to get relief on taxes, whether it be before or after retirement.
4. Tax-deductible, so if you earn $75,000 annually and you contribute $10,0000 then you'll only be taxed on $65,000. This is the idea of pre-tax, as they make you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement, but you save money if you have a lower-income (lower tax bracket).
- Cons:
1. Not much control over plan, investment costs. As well as this there's a limited selection of investment choices.
2. Distributions (withdrawals) in retirement are taxed as ordinary income with a traditional 401(k).
3. Starting at age 72, you're required to withdraw a certain amount each year. This is called the required minimum distributions.

## Individual Retirement Plans (IRAs or Individual Retirement Account)
An individual account that you go get with a bank or broker on your own, not connected with an employer. However there are two types of IRAs, traditional and Roth.

## Traditional IRA
You put money in up to a maximum limit, and it's on a pre-tax basis so it's not taxed upfront. Then the money can be reinvested whilst in the plan, and then once you retire you will pay some taxes on some of the accumulated amount in your plan. Very similar to a 401k. Of course, there are some differences such as how the 401k has employer involvment, contribution limits, access permissions, etc. but essentially they serve the same purpose. 

## Roth IRA
You pay the taxes upfront, so it's paid with after tax dollars. It can now grow tax-free, meaning you don't pay taxes on interest, dividends, or capital gains earned within the account. 
- 5 year rule: You must wait 5 years after your first contribution to be able to withdraw your contributions tax-free.
- Can withdraw contributions with no penalty. So 'contributions' are just the after-tax dollars you put in, and yeah since they've already been taxed they let you withdraw it without penalties. However any earnings are still subject to penalties, and taxes if you withdraw before the 5 year rule.
- Income limit: As of 2024, you can't contribute to a Roth IRA if you have over $146,000 annually as a single or head or household.
### Pros and Cons of Roth IRA
- Pros
1. Large investment selection, including stocks, mutual funds
2. Contributions can be withdrawn at any time, but earnings may incur taxes. Meaning you can withdraw any money you've directed contributed without paying taxes or penalties. This is because you've already paid taxes on that moeny. However the extra earnings from your investments you may have to pay taxes and incur a penalty if you withdraw early (before 59.5 years old typically).
3. No required minimum distributions, meaning you aren't forced to withdraw a certain amount every year.
- Cons:
1. Lower annual contribution limits. So in 2024, the annual maximum is $7000 for those under 50 years old.
2. No immediate tax benefit from contributing, as the benefit comes later when your savings are taxed free in retirement.
3. At higher incomes, you may not be qualified for a Roth IRA. So if you have more than the income limit, and you still want a Roth IRA, you want to do a 'Backdoor Roth IRA'. Simplified, this is the idea of having a regular IRA and converting it to a Roth. 

### Considerations for Roth IRA
1. Best if you're young and in a low tax bracket, and expecting to make more in the older years.
2. Worse if you're in a high tax bracket when you're young, so you're making a lot of money when you're young and expecting that to decrease on retirement.


## Consenus
### Roth IRA Route
If you're young and in a low tax bracket, prioritize the Roth IRA. This is a generally good idea as you're going to be paying less taxes, and the put you put in and are earning in the Roth IRA is going to be tax free when you retire. 

### Roth 401k Route
Low taxes upfront and tax free growth is very powerful, so also don't forget that your employer could offer a Roth 401(k), which could be great as well as you could be getting a match as well.

### 401k route
If you currently making a ton of money right now (high tax bracket), and you're expecting that you'll retire in a low tax bracket, then investing in a 401k will be the ideal option to save you money.

### Balancing both
A lot of the time it's a good idea to invest into a 401(k) and a Roth IRA. You'd contribute to the 401(k) until employer match (free money). Then you invest the remaining of your saved money into your Roth IRA (try to max it out). This allows you to invest in individual stocks and things you choose yourself. If you're able to max out the Roth IRA, you can decide if you want to continue contributing to your 401(k) beyond your employer match or just put that money towards other savings. 

When investing into your 401k, stick to index funds with the lowest fees possible. Anything with an expense ratio of less than 0.2%, but up to 0.5% is still fine since 401k fees are always a little higher. However anything near or above 1% should be avoided. Of course this option is a bit expensive as you're contributing to both accounts.
 
## Questions about my personal finanical situation
If you have questions more specific to your financial situation it's best to ask your brokerage or bank that manages your retirement funds or money. As well as this, if your employer offers a 401k, it's good to ask them since they may have resources and people to answer your questions.

Also don't forget that you can use online calculators to check your earnings and future projected savings.

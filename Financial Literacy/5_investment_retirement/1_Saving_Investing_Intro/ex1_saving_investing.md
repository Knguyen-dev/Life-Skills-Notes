## Saving vs. Investing
- Liquidity: Refers to the eas at which an asset can be converted to cash. A savings account has high liquidity as we can easily withdraw money from it anytime. However, it may not be as easy to sell or convert an investment into cash.
- Risk: Potential for your money to lose value. Your savings in a bank account is low risk, whilst stock market investments have a higher risk, since their values can go up and down.
- Return: Amount of money we either gain or lose on your investment. Savings account have low returns, but at least they're positive so you're gaining money. An investment has higher returns, but this could be positive (gaining money) or negative (losing money).
- Time horizon: How long you plan to keep your money invested or saved. If you need your money soon, saving it is typically better. However, if you have a long time before you'll need the money, investing cna help you grow more.

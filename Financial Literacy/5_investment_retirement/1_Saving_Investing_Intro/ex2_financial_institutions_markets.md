## Examples of financial institutions
### Banks
Popular choice to save money and earn interest. Can also provide loans and credit cards for puchases. Some also provide services for stocks and mutual funds. Depending on the bank, it could be a one stop shop for all financial needs.

### Lenders
Instituions that lend money to businesses and people. Of course banks and credit unions also do this, but there are some companies where they're only service is to lend people money. 


### Credit unions
Similar to banks, but you typically have to become a member and be qualified. For example there are teacher credit unions, where you have to be a teacher to become a member. Or a town credit union, where you have to live in a specific town to qualify. Anyways, members just get better interest rates on savings accounts, and lower interest rates on loans. They also provide various services like banks.

### Brokerage firms and investment companies

## Examples of financial markets
### Stock markets
Places where people can invest in shares of companies, like Apple or Amazon. Investors can buy or sell stocks, which represent ownership in a company, and potentially earn profits as the company grows.

### Bond Markets
Where people can invest or buy bonds. By doing this you are just lending money to a company, government, or issuer for a specified period. In return the issuer will agree to pay you back with interest when it's all said and done.

Of course there are potential risks. Interest rates and bond prices are inversely related, so when their prices go up, the interest rate that we earn goes down. And also there's the risk of a company not being able to pay you back, usually associated with lower level companies. Generally low risk, so don't expect the returns to be crazy.

### Money Markest
Where people can invest in 'short-term debt securities'. These are things that mature, when the issuer pays you back, in a year or less. Like treasury bills and certificates of deposit.

Treasury bills are a way for the U.S. govenrment to raise money for itself. You buy a T-Bill at a discounted price than face value, then the difference between the purchase price and face value of the bill is the 'investor return' (how much you get back plus your original money). This acts as the 'interest'.

For example, you buy a $1,000 T-Bill for $950 dollars. Then after period of time, the government pays you back your original $950 purchase price, and then the $50. As a result, you get $50.

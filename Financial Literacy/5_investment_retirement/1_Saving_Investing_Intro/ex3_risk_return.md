# Risk and Return

## What is risk and return?
- Risk: The uncertainty of the outcome of an investmnet. Essentially the chance that your investment won't make as much as you hoped, or causes you to lose money.
- Return: Amount you gained or lost from an investment. A positive return means your investment made money while a negative return means you lost money.

## How risk and return are related
Generally, higher risk means higher return, and the other way around. For example, investing in a company with a strong track record has low risk, but it likely has low reaards too. But investing in an unproven start up is high risk, and high return.

## Return on investment (ROI)
Helps you figuure out how much money you've made from an investment, compared to how much you put in. For example, if you invested $100, but got $150, your ROI is 50%. This means you have 50% more money than you started with. Here's the formula:

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{ \text{Current value of investment} - \text{Initial investment} }{ \text{Initial investment} } \times 100
$$

So an investment of $1000 that's now worth $1200 would have an ROI 20%. This is a positive return, so that's a good investment.

$$
\text{ROI} = \dfrac{\blueE{\$1{,}200}-\purpleE{\$1{,}000}}{\purpleE{\$1{,}000}} \times 100 = 20\%
$$

Most of the time you don't have to od the math for online investments, such as buying stocks and whatnot. But there are times when this isn't the case, so knowing how to calculate it on your own is good.


## Rule of 72
A math formula that helps us estimate how long it'll take for our omney to double when we invest it. Essentially just divide 72 by the interest rate or ROI. As a result, we get the approx. number of yeras it'll take for our money to double

For example, if we invest money and have an annual interest rate of 6%. Do 72 / 6 = 12 years. So it'll take about 12 years for our money to double.

This is helpful as it shows you how much money you can make overtime. We can quickly see how long it'll take our money to double wiht different ROIs/interest rates.

# More on investing
Let's talk about how different types of investments work, and how yo ucan make money with them.

## Stocks
When we buy stocks we buy a small piece of ownership in a company. The value of stocks can potentially increase (capital appreciation), and dividend income (money companies pay to stockholders).

We make money by selling stocks at a higher price than we bought them, or receiving dividends. Not all companies pay out dividends and also they can be in varying amounts.

## Bonds
Investment where you lend money to the government or company. In return, the issuer of the bond  will pay you back with interest payments, and then your principal amount at the end of the term. For example, if you buy a $1,000 bond with a 5% annual interest rate, you'd receive $50 each year, and then your $1,000 back when the bond matures. Bonds can have short terms like 1 year, while others can have terms of over 30 years. Bonds typically offer lower risk and return compared to stock, but both depend on the issuer's creditworthiness and interest rate changes.

## Mutual funds
Investment where many people pool their money together to buy various different stocks, bonds, and other investments. By doing this, they're able to reduce risk because even if one of their investments don't do well, they have many others that they can fall back on. Mutual funds are managed by professionals, so regular people who are pooling in money don't have to worry about making the decisions.

You make money from dividends, interests from investments, or by selling the fund's shares at a higher rate than they were bought. This generates 'capital gains', which is money that we get that we'll share to all sharefolders of the mutual fund. Of course the amount of money a shareholder gets depends on the number of shares they hold in the mutual fund, which makes sense as the people who put in more will receive more.

## Diversification
The idea or strategy of not putting all of your eggs in one basket. We try to reduce risk and increase return by having a mix of different types of investments. As a result, when some are doing bad, others could be doing well, which can help balance out your overall returns.

How to diversify your investment portfolio:
- Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
- Choose investments from different industries and sectors.
- Include both domestic and international investments.

More to think about when diversifying your portfolio:
1. Risk tolerance: How much are you willing to take? If you're low risk, invest in safer assets such as bonds and stocks that pay dividends. Else choose to invest in riskier stocks and opportunities.
2. Time horizon: How long until you need money. If it's a longer time frame, invest in riskier assiets as you'd have more time to recover from potential market downturns. Else if you have a short time frame, go with safe investments.
3. Financial goals: Finally think about your financial goals. It may be more important to od tings such as saving for retirement, saving for your kids' education, buying a house, etc. Think about this when making your portfolio.
